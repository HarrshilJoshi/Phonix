- 🔁 Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 🎧 Firebase for user authentication and storage
- ✅ ESLint for code quality
- 🎨 CSS Modules / Tailwind (optional styling)
- 🔌 Vite Plugins (`@vitejs/plugin-react`)

---

## 📦 Production Build

To generate a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## 🧪 Linting

Basic ESLint rules are configured:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To extend linting, especially in larger projects, add:

* `typescript-eslint`
* `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
* `eslint-config-prettier`

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Environment-specific secrets (like Firebase config) are stored in a `.env` file, which is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

> Do not commit this file to GitHub.

## 🔥 Plugins

You can choose between:

* `@vitejs/plugin-react`: uses Babel for Fast Refresh
* `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: uses SWC (faster builds for large apps)

To switch, edit `vite.config.js`.
